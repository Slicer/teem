Things that would be good for a future airString or airBuffer
 * string dynamically reallocated on write, with optional cap on
   allowed size, maybe allowing control of whether reaching that size
   is an error
 * when reading from a file, allow the file to be gzip'd, so that 
   all the subsequent IO can be blind to whether the file was 
   compressed or not
 * unify sprint'ing into string, or fwrite'ing to file
 * unify reading from string, or from file
 * when writing to string, should be remembering where last output is,
   to avoid needless repeated calls to strlen
 * should this be the thing that can make stdin fseek-able?
 * could use one of these as wrapper around stderr for normal output of 
   unrrduCmds, but allowing it to be saved to string in case the command
   is being invoked from C

An OS-general means of:
* generating a unique temp file name
* removing a given file (for cleaning up temp file)

Fix Windows implementation of airTime()

fix airSinglePrintf to not put a space before double-type special values
("%4s" hack has to go)

complete fprintf/sprintf/printf stand-in: use trio?
complete fscanf/sscanf stand-in

Decide if air will have a general-purpose thread-safe progress indication
scheme, or if this will be each library's responsibility
